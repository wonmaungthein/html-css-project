              <h2> Consistency</h2> 
                <p>"Consistency is as important as correctness. How can you ever be true to your word if your actions are constantly inconsistent? Inconsistency is inherently sketchy and causes people to believe you have an alternative motive. This is both a factor in personal relationships, as well as business, and even fitness routines. Essentially, consistency can be attributed to any aspect of life." by Ashley Fern.

            <h2>Let's find out more information to develop skills!</h2>  
              <p>This is a website where you can find information to develop your personal skills. "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
              It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
              it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
              College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
              a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
              discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
              of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
              This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first 
              line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32."
