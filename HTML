      <h2>Let's find out more information to develop skills!</h2>  
        <p>This is a website where you can find information to develop your personal skills. "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
        it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
        a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
        discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
        of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first 
        line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32."

    <h2> Consistency</h2> 
      <p>"Consistency is as important as correctness. How can you ever be true to your word if your actions are constantly inconsistent? Inconsistency is inherently sketchy and causes people to believe you have an alternative motive. This is both a factor in personal relationships, as well as business, and even fitness routines. Essentially, consistency can be attributed to any aspect of life." by Ashley Fern.

    <h2 class= "ArticleTwo" aside role="complementary">Motivation</h2> 
      <p>"Motivation is important because it is the psychological catalyst employees and owners require to reach the goal. Without goal setting and the necessary motivation for goal attainment, businesses are without purpose or direction" by Matt McKay.To read more about <a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-motivation-goal-setting-businesses-2506.html">motivation.</a></p>

    <h2 class="ArticleThree">Set the goal</h2>
      <p>Business goal setting is important because it turns aspirations into tangible objects which require commitment and action. Used for measuring performance, increasing revenue and meeting business challenges, <a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-motivation-goal-setting-businesses-2506.html">goals</a> ideally include specific guidelines, details and outline resources necessary for attainment. The act and practice of goal setting allows the business and its employees to gauge the direction the business wishes to go, and can give credence to established business models, mission statements and overall objectives.</p>
